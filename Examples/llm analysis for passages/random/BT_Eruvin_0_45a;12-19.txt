ENGLISH:
Since the Gemara discussed war on Shabbat, the Gemara cites Rav Yehuda, who said that Rav said: With regard to gentiles who besieged Jewish towns, they may not go out to fight against them with their weapons, nor may they desecrate Shabbat in any other way due to them, but rather they must wait until after Shabbat. That was also taught in a baraita , with a caveat: With regard to gentiles who besieged, etc. In what case is this said? It is said in a case where the gentiles came and besieged the town with regard to monetary matters, i.e., banditry. However, if they came with regard to lives, i.e., there is concern that the gentiles will attack, they may go out against them with their weapons, and they may desecrate Shabbat due to them. And with regard to a town that is located near the border, even if the gentiles did not come with regard to lives, but rather with regard to matters of hay and straw, i.e., to raid and spoil the town, they may go out against them with their weapons, and they may desecrate Shabbat due to them, as the border must be carefully guarded, in order to prevent enemies from gaining a foothold there. Rav Yosef bar Manyumi said that Rav Nahman said: And Babylonia is considered like a town located near the border, and war may be waged there on Shabbat even if the gentiles came for financial gain. And this means the city of Nehardea, which was located near the border. Rabbi Dostai of the town of Biri expounded: What is the meaning of that which is written: And they told David, saying: Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keila, and they rob the threshing floors (i Samuel 23:1), after which David asked God how he should respond. It was taught in a baraita : Keila was a town located near the border, and the Philistines came only with regard to matters of hay and straw, as it is written: And they rob the threshing floors. And in the next verse it is written: Therefore David inquired of the Lord, saying: Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said to David: Go and smite the Philistines, and save Keila (i Samuel 23:2), which indicates that war may be waged in a border town on Shabbat, even with regard to monetary matters.The Gemara refutes this proof by asking: What is Davids dilemma? If you say that he had a halakhic question and was in doubt whether it was permitted or prohibited to fight the Philistines on Shabbat, it is possible to respond: But the court of Samuel from Rama was then in existence, and rather than inquire by way of the Urim VeTummim he should have inquired of the Great Sanhedrin. Rather, he asked: Will he succeed or will he not succeed in his war? The Gemara comments: This is also precise in the language of the verse, as it is written in the response to Davids query: Go and smite the Philistines, and save Keila. Learn from this, from the assurance that God gave David of his victory, that this was the subject of his inquiry.
