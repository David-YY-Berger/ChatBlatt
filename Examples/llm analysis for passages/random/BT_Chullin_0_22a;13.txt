HEBREW:
מתני׳ כשר בתורין פסול בבני יונה כשר בבני יונה פסול בתורין תחלת הציהוב בזה ובזה פסול:

ENGLISH:
MISHNA: It is written with regard to bird offerings: He shall bring his offering of doves, or of young pigeons (Leviticus 1:14). The age that is fit for sacrifice in doves, mature birds, is unfit for sacrifice in pigeons, immature birds;the age that is fit for sacrifice in pigeons is unfit for sacrifice in doves. At the intermediate stage of the beginning of the yellowing of its plumage (see 22b), a bird is unfit both as this, a pigeon, and as that, a dove, since it is no longer a fledgling but is not yet a mature bird.
